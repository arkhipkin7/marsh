# Marsh Project

**This issue was the topic of my bachelor thesis**

## Intro
### Description of the issue: Recognize negative content in social networks.

### Fromal statement of the issue: Develop a multi-class image classifier

### Steps:
- data Collection:
  - development of parser for downloading images from social networks;
  - marking up data by group name;
  - separation of data into training and test sets.
- data preprocessing;
- develop of a convolutional neural network model (in this case, the ResNet architecture with 32 hidden layers was implemented);
- test model on test dataset;
- visualization of model results in Jupyter.

Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
